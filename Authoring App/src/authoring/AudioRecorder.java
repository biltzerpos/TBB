/**
 * AudioRecorder class
 *
 * This class is intended to be used as a dependency by a client GUI class to
 * record audio from a microphone and save it as a .wav file. This class
 * configures and stores the parameters of the input lines needed for audio
 * recording, such as sample rate, without need for user input. Before
 * recording, a user should set the name of the file they want the audio to be
 * saved to using the method setFileName(). Audio recording started by calling
 * the recordAudio() method, and stopped by calling the stopAudio() method.
